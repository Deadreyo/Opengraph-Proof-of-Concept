# Opengraph Proof of Concept

This is the proof of concept behind OpenSauced's [Opengraph project](https://github.com/open-sauced/opengraph.opensauced.pizza).

## What is the Opengraph project?

It is a project that aims to create custom social cards for OpenSauced users & services, similar to GitHub's social cards. It is aimed to create custom social cards for user profile, user highlights, and insight pages, that better reflect the user's personality and the project's purpose.

## How does it work?

We used Satori for image generation & satori-html to replace the need for React elements.

## How to run it?

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Visit `localhost:3000/:name` to see the social card. (Replace `:name` with your name)
